# hello-world
Hi there.

I was a student of CS for about 7 years, but I haven't done anything other than simple ahk for a few years now, and the company I work at right now has a terrible, buggy website that I'm going to try to work on. I've never done web development, only data structures in Java and a little assembly, so working through TOP right now.
